# Microservices-based software architecture lesson

This is my version of [Oswaldo Neto](https://github.com/oswaldoneto)'s microservices-based software architecture lesson, during which we've developed a Java project with Spring Cloud. This is part of Santander's [Bootcamp 2021](https://app.becas-santander.com/pt-BR/program/santanderbootcamp) scholarship program in partnership with [Digital Innovation One ](https://digitalinnovation.one/).
